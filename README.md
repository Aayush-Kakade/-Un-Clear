# **SoC 2021 (Un)Clear**

> *Welcome! You have landed on the repository for the SoC 2021 project, (Un)Clear.*

# The Project:

The main aim of this project is to build and implement the ERSGAN model from scratch using OpenCV and TensorFlow for Image Super-Resolution. Image Super-Resolution is a method used to convert a lower resolution image into a higher resolution image.

# Flow of the project:

## Week 0: Basics of Python and Introduction to GitHub

- Covered the basics of Python from a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh).
- Got introduced to Git and GitHub from a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh). 

## Week 1: Image processing using OpenCV and Introduction to Machine Learning

- Got introduced to OpenCV which is an amazing library for image processing.
- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/Aayush-Kakade/-Un-Clear/tree/main/OpenCV%20Assignment): Using basic OpenCV functions.
- Started [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) offered by Google.

## Week 2: Basics of Machine Learning and Introduction to TensorFlow:

- Finished off the crash course provided by google.
- Started a course on [Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187) offered by Udacity.
- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/Aayush-Kakade/-Un-Clear/tree/main/Digit-Recognizer): Developed a Digit Recognizer using CNNs on Kaggle.

## Week 3: ResNet architecture, GAN and CGAN:

- Learned about a very powerful convolutional model known as Residual Neural Network [(ResNet)](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-resnet-model-from-scratch-971be7193718).
- Got introduced to Generative Adversarial Network [(GAN)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxQ7SoCLQAMGgQAIAcyRevM8VvygTpCu) and Conditional GAN [(CGAN)](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-89ef35a60b69).
- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/Aayush-Kakade/-Un-Clear/tree/main/Assignment%203): Implemented CGAN to make a model for converting pencil sketches to coloured images.

## Week 4: SRGAN and ESRGAN models:

- Studied about some recent research papers in this field, which were Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks [(SRGAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802). and Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks [(ESRGAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219).
- [Assignment 4](https://github.com/Aayush-Kakade/-Un-Clear/tree/main/ESRGAN%20Implementation): Started implementation of the ESRGAN model with the help of a [tutorial](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/esrgan-enhanced-super-resolution-generative-adversarial-network-using-keras-a34134b72b77).

## Week 5 and 6: Completing the ESRGAN model implementation and documentation:

- Finished implementing the ESRGAN model.
- Final video making and documentation.
