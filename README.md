# SoC 2021 (Un)Clear

This project is based on Image Super Resolution which started in the first week of April 2021. This was a learning project in which included the following topics:

## Image processing using OpenCV:

- Started off with the basics of image processing like smoothening and blurring of images, switching between different colour systems, rotation etc.
- Later we covered some advanced algorithms and functions.
- Lastly we wrapped up this topic with an assignment on OpenCV which included live web camera video capture, switching between colour systems and making a pencil sketch from live webcam footage.

## Basics of Machine Learning:

- We started off with a course on machine learning offered by google which was more like a theoritical course which covered different types of sets, neural networks and embeddings.

## Introduction to Tensorflow:

- We started off with a course on tensorflow offered by udacity which covered CNNs and transfer learning.
- We wraaped up this topic with an assignment in which we developed a machine learning model to recognize hand written digits. We used an oline platform kaggle for this assignment.

## ResNet, GAN and CGAN:

- Studied about ResNet i.e Residual Neural Network.
- Introduction to GAN i.e Generative Adversial Network and Conditional GAN.
- Assignment: Implementing CGAN to extract colour images out from pencil sketches.

## SRGAN and ESRGAN:

- Studied some new papers in this field about SRGAN(Super-Resolution Generative Adversial Network) and ERSGAN(Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks).
- Final Implementaion: Implemented the ERSGAN model.
